<p>For those who use <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashbuilder_burrito/">Flash Builder Burrito</a> and parsley, <a href="http://francois.de-campredon.fr/public/parsley/metadata.xml">here</a> is a xml file you can use to obtain parsley metadata code completion.</p>
<p>To use that file, create a library project and include that file with -include-file compiler argument, add the swc obtained in your project, and that should work.</p>
<p>I can't give any guarantee about that file being complete, however I tried to respect the parsley documentation.</p>
