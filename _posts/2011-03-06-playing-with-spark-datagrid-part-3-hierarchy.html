<p>For this time here is an attempt of implementing IHierarchicalData support, since spark DataGrid only support IList as dataProvider I have written a little adapter that implement IList and ICollectionView that allows to get data from a IHierarchicalData as  source.<br />
This implementation has been greatly inspired by the <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/aharui/2011/02/sparkdatagridwithhierarchy.html">Alex Harui one</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Grouping DataGrid" href="http://francois.de-campredon.fr/public/AdvancedSparkDataGrid/Group/" target="_blank">sample</a> | <a title="Spark Group DataGrid" href="http://francois.de-campredon.fr/public/AdvancedSparkDataGrid/AdvancedSparkDatagrid.zip">source</a></p>
<p>note : this implementation has not been tested enough and can contain bugs.</p>
<p>This is for the moment the last part of my experiments with spark DataGrid, the next feature I would like to implement is a ItemRenderProvider equivalent of the mx AdvancedDatagrid , however this seems to be a lot of work, and I do not know if I can accomplish it without completely refactoring the spark Grid component (what I absolutely do not want to do).<br />
I'll perhaps try in the future  to improve my implementation and provide a well tested component, or to add new features.</p>
